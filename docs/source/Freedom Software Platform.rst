After gaining access credentials and selecting your API Client implementation (Java or Python), you will be ready to integrate with the ATLAS Freedom API to create your spacecraft resources.
This is done in three steps:

# Define the "Band Details": Uplink and downlink bands that contain RF information about the communication link with the spacecraft(s).
# Define the "Satellite Configuration": Contains mission details for the spacecraft(s).
# Define the "Satellite": Contains the core details specific to one spacecraft.
