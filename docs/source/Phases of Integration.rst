Phases of Integration
=====================

.. _Phase 1 - Data Collection:

Phase 1 - Data Collection
-------------------------

This phase begins the moment a customer signs a contract. ATLAS requests the following items to ease transition through later technical phases:

        | desired ConOps based on the capabilities of the spacecraft. It primarily answers the questions:
       
        | For each mode of Operation...
        | * What frequency band(s) are used?
        | * What link type(s) are used (Transmit, Receive, or Both)?
        * What are the signal characteristics? I.e. modulation(s), data rate(s), polarization(s)
